#create histograms of travel times between antennas 
#this is the basis for creating an algorthm to extract the typical fast travel time distribution (without stops 
#somewhere)
#ideas: fit gaussian distr. 
# - maybe the modes of transport ( car, plane, ...) should be clustered before?
# - how can I validate the distribution?
#   - definately compare to simple distance-carspeed calculation
#   - validate with results from other orange paper on travel times between cities
#   - crosscheck by adding two (or more) distances that combine to make the journey

#ISSUES:
# - number of travels between some antennas are very low resulting in unreliable traveltime estimates ("peak is less clear")
#   - POSSIBLY CAN BE RESOLVED BECAUSE TRAVEL TIMES TO HOSPITALS ARE TYPICALLY LESS THEN 500MIN (200KM IN ORANGE PAPER) WHERE 
#     ESTIMATES ARE VARYING LESS DRAMATICALLY 
#To Do 
# - implement typical travel time extraction strategy as in orange paper
# - run with more data to see how smooth the distributions are
# - ESTIMATE HOW LONG THE CODE WOULD RUN WITH FOR LOOPS AND ALL DATA -> DECIDE WHETHER I NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY (EULER
#   ODER MORE EFFICIENT FUNCTIONS)

#!!!!!!!!!CALCULATE ONLY TO HOSPITAL SITES TO SAVE TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#STEPS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
#users visits to one site first and then the other

#for user_ID
# visits where First site is visited then second without the first again in between

# find incidence of visit to first
# look to next observation
# if visit to the same site, save the new time as starttime
# if not the same go through further observations of this user to find visit to second site
# lock arrival this time 
# calculate this difference and save to vector of this site combination (has direction)
# continue with this process on this user until no data for this user is left
